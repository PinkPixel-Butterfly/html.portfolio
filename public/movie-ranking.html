<h1>My Favorite Movies of all TIME!! <br /> by Leandri Jackson</h1>

<h2>Top 3 - Animation Movies</h2>

    <h3>1. Gnomeo and Juliet</h3>
    I am a sucker for Romeo and Juliet and the animation movie about Gnomes just pulled my heart strings. In Highschool we did a movie review for our English marks in Matric. The animantions are good and I absolutely love the story line with gnomes. This
    is my number 1 because it easily came to mind when a thought about it</p>

    <h3>2. How to Train your Dragon</h3>
    I love Toothless the NightFury Dragon and his rider. Showing that even if you are different to the people around you. You can do anything if you put your mind to it. Be yourself and maybe you can change the perspectives of the people around you, or your
    whole town. I also want to ride a dragon.

    <h3>3. Barbie and the 12 Princeses </h3>
    I have grown up knowing the Barbie movies, and this is one of my all time favourite Barbie movies. Where 12 sisters dance together and break a bad spell within their world. I will watch this movie again one day. </p>
